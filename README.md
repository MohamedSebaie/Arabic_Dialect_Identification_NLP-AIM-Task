# Arabic_Dialect_Identification_NLP-AIM-Task
 ### Arabic has a widely varying collection of dialects. Many of these dialects remain under-studied due to the rarity of resources. 

The goal of AIM task is to classifying the dialect of the tweet writer given the tweet itself.

#### I used two approches:
##### 1- Machine Learning Aproach Using `LinearSVC`
##### 2- Deep Learning Approach Using `AraBERT Transformer`
